## Why Z-EVES??

Neither I know why or for what you should use this shit... but let me tell you something...

You maybe need to use it. If you (like me) are studying Software Engineering or any Computer Science related degree, you may be prompt to use this shit. Yes.

This is a linux version (that I used to use) for z-eves. So, why linux? because Windows is a shit and with this z-eves shit the fucking shit is gonna happen... all right, basically, z-eves close unexpectedly when you scroll... yes, a dumb shit... you cannot scroll when using z-eves on windows. So please, use linux.
