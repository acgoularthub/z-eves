# Z-EVES for linux

## Instalation and usage

1. Clone this repo anywhere
2. Copy its contents in a new directory in `/opt/Z`
3. Run `bash /opt/Z/Z-Eves/system/z-eves-gui.sh`

## Why Z-EVES??

Neither I know why or what you should use this shit... but let me tell you something...

You maybe need to use it. If you (as me) are stuying Software Engineering at UADY. You will be prompt to use this shit. Yes you will.

This is a linux version (what I used to use) for z-eves. So, why linux? because Windows is a shit and with this z-eves shit all the fucking shit is gonna happen... basically, z-eves close unexpectally when you scroll.. yes my friend... you cannot scroll when using z-eves in windows. So please, use linux.
