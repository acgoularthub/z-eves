## Why Z-EVES??

Neither I know why or for what you should use this shit, but let me tell you something.

You maybe need to use it if you (like me) are studying Software Engineering or any Computer Science related degree, you may be prompt to use this shit.

This is a linux version (that I used to use) for z-eves. So, why linux? because Windows is a shit.
